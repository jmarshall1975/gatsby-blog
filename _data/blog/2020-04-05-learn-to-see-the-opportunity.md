Let's play a game.

I'll start a well-known saying, and you finish it for me.

1. When life gives you lemons...
2. Every cloud has...
3. The early bird...

Bet you got all three, didn't you? These platitudes are so commonplace that's they're sometimes easy to dismiss as the sort of self-affirmative mantras doled out through endless social media posts.

However, every cliched proverb contains a grain of truth, and these are no exception.

I had started to write this post several weeks before the coronavirus pandemic changed our world in ways we could never have imagined, but as I sit here I feel the need to express this more than ever. The message is more necessary than ever, especially for those of us facing an uncertain future.
